Stochastic Multiobjective optimization control

The process and the method is same as another repository however mine previous method was deterministic disturbance introduction but this repository has stochastic disturbance introduction to the system.




Hovever the method is under development, as stochastic with multiple shooting is very rare to find when we do online research.  But, let's see how I end up once the programming is complete.

So, it is better as of now not try to learn from this code.
